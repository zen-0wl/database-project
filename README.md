> A collaborative group project automating the operations that undergo the Ramadan fundraiser on Malaysia’s elderly society (RFMES). 
> In this charity, each donor is assigned to a single donee which allows the elderly donee to communicate their needs directly to the donor. Individuals can also volunteer in the elderly society and help multiple elderly at the same time with chores that are too physically challenging. The proposed framework is called the Ramadan Fundraiser tracking and registration system. At the current moment volunteers, donors and donee have to manually fill up forms that are handwritten and uploaded into a file based system. The registration and tracking system allows end users to fill out forms online and also track and update the donation amount made, the donee needs and addition of new volunteers. The new Registration system will replace the manual processes with an implemented database system.
